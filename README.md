Project title : Pizzeria A & P             

This is a presentation web page for a pizza restaurant. I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.
I used Visual Studio Code and I worked on Live Server. You have to download all files and "Go live" from Studio Code for the site to work properly.
The first page is home.html and you can start from there.
The search bar is working only in "Meniu pizza" page and the search starts after you enter the first 3 letters of the word.
The "Cos" page is initially empty and after you add a pizza other fields will appear and have to be completed before you make the order.
In "Admin" you can log in with an email that has to contain "@" and the passord is predefined in code (adina07). From "Admin" section you can add new pizza`s and after you click "Adauga" the pizza will appear in "Meniu pizza" and can be added in the basket to order it.
There is a predefined pizza list and from "Admin" section you can reset the list to initial if you click on "Reseteaza la initial" button. By clicking that button all new pizza added will be deleted.

I am looking to add buttons to delete the pizza`s from basket if the customer changes his mind and maybe adding buttons to choose the size of the pizza (small, medium, large).

Enjoy !
